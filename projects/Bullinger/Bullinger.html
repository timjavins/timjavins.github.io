				<div class="panel-body">
					<p><strong>R.W. Bullinger</strong> (1837–1913) was not only a theologian and scholar, but also an early practitioner of what we now call <em>data science</em>. His treatises reveal a mind deeply engaged in the analysis of numbers, patterns, and timelines, drawing significance from recurrence and structure.</p>
					<h3>Numbers & Recurrence</h3>
					<p>Bullinger meticulously catalogued the recurrence of numbers in biblical texts, seeking meaning in their frequency and distribution. His approach mirrors modern statistical analysis, where significance is often found in patterns and anomalies.</p>
					<h3>Time Series Analysis</h3>
					<p>By examining events across time, Bullinger generated timelines and identified cycles, much like a data scientist working with time series data. He cross-referenced events using various calendars—Hebrew, Julian, Gregorian—demonstrating an advanced understanding of temporal data alignment.</p>
					<h3>Calendar Cross-Referencing</h3>
					<p>Bullinger’s work involved synchronizing disparate calendar systems to create unified historical timelines. This process is akin to modern data integration, where datasets from different sources are merged for deeper insight.</p>
					<h3>Legacy</h3>
					<p>Through his analytical rigor, Bullinger stands as a forerunner to today’s data scientists, showing how careful study of numbers and time can reveal profound truths. His legacy inspires us to look for meaning in data, patterns, and the passage of time.</p>
