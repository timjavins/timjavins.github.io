				Throughout my career, I have embraced challenges and opportunities with curiosity and ambition. My journey began as a freelance web developer and an underage college student in the 90s, evolved into a creative pursuit as a musician in the 2000s, and matured through entrepreneurial ventures into the 2010s. Each experience has shaped my professional approach, emphasizing continual learning and resilience.

				Driven by a passion for data and technology, I discovered my affinity for data science after learning about the "unicorn" Data Scientist role—a description that resonated with me. I felt like corporate America finally found a high-value role appropriate for me. I have dedicated hundreds of hours to data engineering and applying my learnings wherever possible. Today, I am focused on delivering impactful solutions as I advance in my career in data.

				This site should have one of those "Please excuse our mess" signs as I subject it to commits in the spirit of building in the open. I gave Copilot a one-liner instruction to build this: <a href="projects/Bullinger/Bullinger.html" target="_blank">EW Bullinger tribute page</a>.
