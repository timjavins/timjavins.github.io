				Throughout my career, I have embraced challenges and opportunities with curiosity and ambition. My journey began as a freelance web developer and a young college student in the 90s, evolved into a creative pursuit as a musician in the 2000s, and matured through entrepreneurial ventures in the 2010s. Each experience has shaped my professional approach, emphasizing innovation, resilience, and leadership.

				Driven by a passion for data and technology, I discovered my affinity for data science after learning about the "unicorn" Data Scientist role—a description that resonated with my diverse skill set. I have dedicated hundreds of hours to mastering the field, engaging with professionals across the industry, and continuously expanding my expertise. Today, I am focused on delivering impactful solutions as I advance in my career as a data scientist.
