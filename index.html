			<h1>Timothy Javins</h1>
			<h2>A curious, ambitious type.</h2>

			<p class="bio">
				Timothy has lived a storied life so far. He was a freelance web developer and exceptionally young college student in the 90s, then a broke musician in the 2000s, and a struggling entrepreneur in the 2010s. Despite having to bootstrap, he has always striven to push his teams forward into the best spaces of innovation.
				<br><br>
				While Timothy has always pursued his passions, he found his calling when a recruiter detailed the "unicorn" Data Scientist, which described him almost exactly. He took a deep-dive of discovery into the career, which included hundreds of hours of learning and dozens of interviews with data scientists, executives, hiring managers, data science team leads, and instructors. He is now becoming a data scientist.
